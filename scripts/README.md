# Scripts subproject

The contents of this directory (python subproject) are considered as experimental and therefore not officially maintained.

We mostly develop here small pieces of code that aid us during development and test phase of the `Vrtool core` software solution. Whenever any of said code pieces gain relevance we move them into a matching location within the `vrtool` project; gaining therefore the status of "supported" and "generally available" as the rest of the `vrtool core` project.
